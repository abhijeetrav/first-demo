# Web Development Project - Portfolio Website

## Description
This is a simple portfolio website built by a beginner in web development. The website is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and accomplishments as I continue learning and growing as a web developer. This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Structure of the website
- CSS: Styling and layout of the website
- JavaScript: Adding interactivity (e.g., form validation, navigation toggles)

## Features
- Responsive Layout: The website is fully responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Project Showcase: A section where I display a few projects I’ve worked on, including descriptions and links to their respective repositories or live demos.
- Contact Form: A simple form that allows users to send inquiries (though it doesn't yet have back-end functionality).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-website.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd portfolio-website
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the website.

    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

    Alternatively, you can right-click the file and select "Open with" to choose your browser.

## How to Use

- The Home page introduces you to my portfolio, providing basic information about me as a web developer.
- Projects section lists various web development projects I have worked on or am currently working on.
- Contact section has a simple form where you can enter your details and message, but note that it currently doesn't have a back-end implemented for form submissions.

## Next Steps
As I continue learning, I plan to add more features to this portfolio, such as:
- Adding a back-end (Node.js or PHP) to process the contact form data.
- Integrating with a database to manage projects dynamically.
- Implementing a blog section for sharing development tutorials and insights.
